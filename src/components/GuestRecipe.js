            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</p>
            <p>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</p>
            <p>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</p>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p> 1. For the levain: Combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, water and starter in a medium bowl and mix to combine. Cover and let sit at room temperature until bubbly and increased in volume by about 20 percent, about 8 hours.</p>
            <p> 2. For the dough: Add the all-purpose flour, water and whole-wheat flour to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Weigh out 7 ounces of the levain (about 1 cup) and add to the mixer (discard any remaining levain). Mix on low until a shaggy dough forms. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</p>
            <p> 3. Add the salt to the dough and mix on medium speed for 2 minutes; the dough should feel a bit sticky and wet but look smooth and very stretchy. Scrape the dough into a plastic or glass container about twice its size. Cover & let sit at room temperature until puffed. Approximately, about 45 minutes.</p>
